# Short story
This is my final project as part of Front-End course led by Prometheus & Ciklum. The main concept was a book store with **signin page**, **catalog**, **specific book page**, **cart**, and additional ones like **purchase done** or **page not found**. Here I used HTML, CSS, JS and React. Pleas, enjoy and feel free to give me a feedback :upside_down_face:
